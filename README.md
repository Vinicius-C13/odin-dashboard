First Commit: 
    I added all the text content of the page and planned how to use flex and grid to do the next step and create the layout of the page.I think that that I'll use flex box only in the header part and use grid to the rest.
    I did the very basic layout of the page in css but i commented it to organize the things better. I wanto to put the attention of this commit in html structure. In the second commit I'll focus on layout and in the third commit the focus will be the page style.
